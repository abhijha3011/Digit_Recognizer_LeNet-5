# Digit_Recognizer_LeNet-5
Features:
Every convolutional layer includes three parts: convolution, pooling, and nonlinear activation functions
Using convolution to extract spatial features (Convolution was called receptive fields originally)
Subsampling average pooling layer
tanh activation function
Using MLP as the last classifier
